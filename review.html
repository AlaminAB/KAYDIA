CBD doesn’t cause the “high” feeling often associated with cannabis. That feeling is caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a different type of cannabinoid.<br>Some people with chronic pain use topical CBD products, in particular CBD oil, to manage their symptoms. CBD oil may reduce:<br>&nbsp; •&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pain<br>&nbsp; •&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inflammation<br>&nbsp; •&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall discomfort related to a variety of health conditions</li>

                        <p>Every morning, when I would wake up in the morning, my legs would start to hurt as soon as I got out of bed.</p>
                          <p>When I got up, the pain got worse, and after a few hours on my feet I had to take off my pants and rub my legs.</p>
                          <p>Sometimes the pain was so bad I had to rest and stay off my feet until I could barely walk again.</p>
                          <p>Then I ordered KAYDIA PATENTED PAIN PATCH after a recommendation from a good friend. I had been reading about pain patches, but most people didn’t know which were effective. But I did a lot of research and discovered that KAYDIA PATENTED PAIN PATCHES were the ones that many people really felt got rid of their pain.</p>
                          <p>I’m a skeptic, so I wasn’t expecting much, but I tried them the same day they arrived, and I walked a few blocks to go shopping.</p>
                          <p>It was incredible. My legs stopped hurting. I don’t know how it happened, but the pain decreased dramatically. I order several more KAYDIA PATCHES so I would not risk running out.</p>

                       <p>I don’t know if you’ve ever had sciatica, but it is the worst pain you can imagine.</p>
                          <p>Just trying to sit up in bed in the morning is an exercise in pain. When you try to straighten up and stand up, the pain is so bad that you can scream. Sometimes it is impossible to stand up at all.</p>
                          <p>I used to have to stand for a half hour in a hot shower just to feel flexible, and I was taking dangerous pain killers. I was worried about getting addicted.</p>
                          <p>Just when I was at the end of my rope, I found out about KAYDIA PATENTED PAIN PATCH. I figured nothing else could work so I gave them a chance.</p>
                          <p>After A FEW DAYS OF WEARING KAYDIA PATCHES, I found that my sciatica symptoms were disappearing! I could finally easily sit up in bed and walk in the morning!</p>
                          <p>I stopped taking the pain killers and I felt great.</p>
                          <p>After using Kaydia patches for three weeks, I no longer had any back pain. And do you know what? I have a lot more energy too.</p>
                          <p>I don’t know how they work but they really do something for me. I recommended them to all my friends and family.</p>

                       <p>Ever since I can remember, I had tension headaches. My neck would feel all stiff and weird, and I would have pain in my neck and shoulders. Sometimes it was so bad that I had to lie down and rest in the dark.</p>
                          <p>I ordered a KAYDIA PATENTED PAIN PATCHES because a friend of mine in my yoga class had tried them and she said they had helped her back pain.</p>
                          <p>I got KAYDIA PATENTED PAIN PATCHES in the mail. They really looked cool (definitely not geeky), and I stuck them on where it hurt.</p>
                          <p>After I wore them only a few days, the tension in my neck got a lot better. I also noticed I had more energy to run, and the pain in my back felt better too. It was hard to believe, but the KAYDIA PATENTED PAIN PATCHES REALLY HELPED ME!</p>
                          <p>I used to get HEADACHES every couple of days. Since I started wearing KAYDIA PATENTED PAIN PATCHES it had been four weeks and I have not had one single headache.</p>
